		<h1>All About Me</h1>
		<h2>Early Life</h2>
		<p>No one (not even me!) knows exactly how old I am. I spent most of my life so far as a stray. Eventually, some people found me and took me to the Humane Society of Huron Valley. They figured out that I was about 6 years old! They kept calling me Kramer, for some reason. Despite the weird name, they cleaned me up, made sure I wasn't being bothered by fleas or other pests, fed me lots of yummy food, and gave me a cozy place to live indoors. Although all the people at HSHV were very nice, I only lived there for about a week. On October 11th, 2015, my day started out very normally, but it ended completely differently than I thought it would.</p>

		<h2>How We Adopted Hammy by Faith</h2>
		<p id ='parenthetical'>(I didn't really know the details about this, so I asked Faith to write this part.)</p>
		<p>For a long time, Liz and I wanted to adopt a cat. Once we finished living in dorms in undergrad, we specifically looked for an apartment where we could have a cat. I wanted a black cat because they are adopted less frequently than other cats. It was important to both of us that we get a cat on the younger side because we wanted to have this cat for as long as possible, and not have to worry about an older cat getting sick while we finished school and started jobs. When we went to the Humane Society of the Huron Valley on October 11th, 2015, we weren't sure what to expect, but we knew that we were ready to take a cat home. We'd already prepared by visiting a pet store, getting the neccessary supplies, and preparing our home for a new little friend. We spent a long time looking at and getting to know cats in the various rooms of the shelter, and though we liked a lot of the cats, none of them were quite right. After a while, Liz went into one of the last rooms, and saw a beautiful black cat. He was very friendly, and let her pet him for a long time. I pet him a little bit too. After a while, we went out into a hallway to think about the cats we had seen, and to try to make a decisions about which cat to adopt. We walked up and down the halls of the Humane Society, but both of us drifted back to the room with the nice black cat we had enjoyed petting so much. Even though he was 6, a little older than we had planned, we knew that this was the cat we wanted to bring home.</p>
		<br>
		<p>So we did.</p>

		<h2>My Life Now</h2>
		<p>Since that Sunday in October, I have lived with Faith and Liz in their apartment. I am very friendly, and love visitors. I especially love visitors who play with me, pet me, or give me treats. Especially the treats. I purr very loudly, and will try to play with/attack pretty much anything. I especially love scratching/destroying the couch. The best thing of all, though, is cuddling with Liz and Faith. Also, walking on their computers when they're trying to do work.</p>
